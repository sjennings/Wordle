# Wordle Offline Version

Wordle Offline is, as the title implies, a version of Wordle that is intended to be run as an offline application.

Anyone can do this by simply saving the Wordle web page and associated files; this simply bundles it all up into an Electron application so non-technical users can easily download and use it.

Wordle was created in 2021 by Josh Wardle. I (Scott Jennings) only packaged it. The packaging is released under a Creative Commons license; no copyright is assumed or implied. 

If you integrate this into your own for-profit application I suspect a certain large media company may have something to say about the subject.
